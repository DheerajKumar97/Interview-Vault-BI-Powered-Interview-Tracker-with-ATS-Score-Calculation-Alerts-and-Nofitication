1. Project Title: Real-Time Analytics Dashboard for E-Commerce Platform

Project Description: Develop a comprehensive real-time analytics dashboard 
that processes and visualizes customer behavior data for an e-commerce 
platform. The system uses a microservices architecture with event-driven 
design, where user interactions are captured via event streams (Apache Kafka), 
processed through a data pipeline (Apache Spark), and stored in a time-series 
database (InfluxDB). The frontend dashboard (React + D3.js) displays live 
metrics including active users, conversion rates, cart abandonment, and 
revenue trends with sub-second latency. The system handles 10,000+ events 
per second, implements real-time alerting for anomalies, and provides 
predictive analytics using machine learning models. This project solves 
the critical business problem of delayed insights by enabling instant 
decision-making based on current customer behavior patterns.

Key Technologies/Skills Used: React, TypeScript, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, 
InfluxDB, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, D3.js, WebSockets, Python, TensorFlow, 
AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda), Grafana

Why it's impressive for this role: This project directly demonstrates your 
ability to build scalable, real-time systems—a core requirement for the 
Senior Software Engineer position. It showcases expertise in distributed 
systems architecture, event-driven design, and data engineering, which are 
explicitly mentioned in the job description. The project proves you can 
handle high-throughput data processing (10K+ events/sec), implement 
microservices patterns, and create responsive user interfaces. Most 
importantly, it shows business acumen by solving a real revenue-impacting 
problem, making you a candidate who understands both technical excellence 
and business value.

- Keys are stored in `.env` file as a JSON array:
  ```env
  GEMINI_API_KEY=["key1", "key2", "key3", ..., "key10"]
  ```
- System automatically rotates through keys when limits are reached

**2. Automatic Key Rotation**:
- When you request AI features (Project Suggestions or Interview Questions):
  1. System tries **API Key #1**
  2. If Key #1 hits rate limit or quota → tries **API Key #2**
  3. If Key #2 fails → tries **API Key #3**
  4. Continues through all 10 keys automatically
  5. No user intervention needed during rotation

**3. User Prompt for Custom Key**:
- If **all 10 default keys are exhausted**:
  - System displays a friendly prompt:
    ```
    ⚠️ Enter Gemini API Key
    
    The default API keys have hit their limits. Please enter your 
    own free API key from Google AI Studio to continue.
    
    [Get Free API Key] → https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
    
    [Input field for API key]
    [Save Key] button
    ```
  - User can get a **free API key** from Google AI Studio
  - Key is saved to backend `.env` file automatically
  - Future requests use the saved custom key

**4. Key Persistence**:
- Once you provide a custom key, it's saved permanently
- System adds your key to the pool
- You won't be prompted again unless your key also hits limits

**Benefits of This System:**
- ✅ **99.9% Uptime**: 10 keys provide redundancy
- ✅ **Zero Interruption**: Automatic failover between keys
- ✅ **User-Friendly**: Only prompts when absolutely necessary
- ✅ **Free for Users**: Default keys cover most usage
- ✅ **Scalable**: Easy to add more keys to the pool

**API Key Limits (Google Gemini Free Tier)**:
- **Rate Limit**: 15 requests per minute per key
- **Daily Quota**: 1,500 requests per day per key
- **With 10 Keys**: Effective capacity of 15,000 requests/day

**How to Get Your Own API Key (If Needed)**:

1. **Visit Google AI Studio**:
   - Go to [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Create API Key**:
   - Click "Create API Key" button
   - Select "Create API key in new project"
   - Copy the generated key (starts with `AIzaSy...`)

3. **Enter in Interview Vault**:
   - Paste key in the prompt when requested
   - Click "Save Key"
   - System validates and saves the key

4. **Key Security**:
   - Keys are stored securely in backend `.env`
   - Never exposed in frontend code
   - Encrypted in database
   - Only used for your requests

**Monitoring Key Usage**:
- System logs show which key is being used
- Console displays: `🔑 Trying API key 1/10...`
- Success message: `✅ Success with API key 1/10`
- Failure message: `❌ API key 1/10 failed, trying next...`

**Best Practices**:
- 🔑 Keep your API key private (don't share)
- 🔄 Regenerate key if compromised
- 📊 Monitor usage in Google AI Studio dashboard
- ⚡ Free tier is sufficient for personal use
